story:
1.take input from command line as a string value representing the url to get the IP of
2.prepare the DNS packet:
    -creating a hardcoded string which represents the Query Header
    -parsing the URL to only get the domain name (along with the subdomains)
    -initializing a list of strings
    -spliting the domain name by '.'
    -copying each resulted in part into the list of strings
    -calculating the length of each of string (as well as the total length)
    -iterating over each string in the list of strings:
        -converting each character of each string into a "Hexadecimal String"
        -reverse the resulted in Hexadecimal Number
        -concat it to the final Packet Buffer which will be returned at the end by the function
3.create a udp socket
4.prepare the server address (currently it's hardcoded into the program 8.8.8.8)
5.send the prepared DNS packet to the server
6.preparing a buffer of size 4096 to receive the server Response
7.wating untill we receive the Response from the server
8.print the response in Plain Text once the receive function finishes its work
9.do a packet cleanup and close the socket
